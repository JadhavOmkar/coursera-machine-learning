    "- So how could you spend your time to improve the accuracy of this classifier?\n",
    "    - Collect lots of data (for example \"honeypot\" project but doesn't always work)\n",
    "    - Develop sophisticated features (for example: using email header data in spam emails)\n",
    "    - Develop algorithms to process your input in different ways (recognizing misspellings in spam).\n",
    "    - It is difficult to tell which of the options will be most helpful.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Selecting the model or approach can be difficult bc there's no clearn approach on how to implement it. \n",
    "    - Thus, Andrew suggest making a simple model and then plotting a learning curve to see if you need more or less data\n",
    "    - Error analysis: Look at all the mistakes or error that the model did. Then, check the information and categorizes on a common ground of these errors. \n",
    "        - Stemming software: In the SPAM/NONSPAM example, it will find words that are the same and treat them the same. \n",
    "- It is very important to get error results as a single, numerical value. Otherwise it is difficult to assess your algorithm's performance. For example if we use stemming, which is the process of treating the same word with different forms (fail/failing/failed) as one word (fail), and get a 3% error rate instead of 5%, then we should definitely add it to our model. However, if we try to distinguish between upper case and lower case letters and end up getting a 3.2% error rate instead of 3%, then we should avoid using this new feature. Hence, we should try new things, get a numerical value for our error rate, and based on our result decide whether we want to keep the new feature or not.\n"
