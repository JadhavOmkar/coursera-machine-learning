Our probability that our prediction is 0 is just the complement of our probability that it is 1 (e.g. if probability that it is 1 is 70%, then the probability that it is 0 is 30%).\n",

    "- If we look at the graph, we notice that the probability of 0.5 occurs towards the right of the y-axis (x=0)\n",
