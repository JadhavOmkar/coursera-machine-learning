About:

Andrew Ng has become a prominent voice for machine learning. He often compare the machine learning revolution with the electricity revolution.

As a student of life, I took this course to gain a better intuition for machine learning. Since this course uses Octave, the coding
will not be relevant to most. Thus, the incredible insight from Andrew Ng made the course worthwhile.
