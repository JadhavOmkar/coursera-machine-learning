    "- Let’s discuss a second way of doing so, this time performing the minimization explicitly and without resorting to an iterative algorithm. In the \"Normal Equation\" method, we will minimize J by explicitly taking its derivatives with respect to the θj ’s, and setting them to zero. This allows us to find the optimum theta without iteration.\n",
