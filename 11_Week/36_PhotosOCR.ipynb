    "1. The first step is to identify where there's text in the image.\n",
    "2. Secondly, we try to segment the words based on the spacing between them!\n",
    "3. Third, we then run a character classifier where we try to predict the characters in the images!\n",
    "    - There are character classifier that can identify if the characters make sense is an actual word. If not, it predict what you the text actually states!\n",

    "- For text detention, when looking for text boxes, we run our sliding windows across the entire image. We extract the values and then we create a black/white image where the white represents information from the sliding window.\n",
    "- Now, to magnfiy probability of correct text boxes, we magnify white spaces that are close together. This is the exansion.\n",

    "- For **STEP 2**, where we character segment the words, we perform the sliding window to extract the carahcters. Hence, we pass it images where it could segment the spaces correctly and incorrrectly. Thus, it will learn how to properly break a split!\n",
